# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

A Python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. Assumes the graph is represented using adjacency lists, where the graph is a dictionary and each key is a node in the graph. The value for each key is a list of tuples, each tuple representing a connection to another node and the cost (weight) of that edge.

### Dependencies
